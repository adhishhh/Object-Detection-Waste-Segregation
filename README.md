# Object-Detection-Waste-Segregation
Object Detection and Waste Segregation Project This project aims to develop a system that can detect and classify different types of waste using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system can help in automating the waste segregation process, which can reduce human error and improve the efficiency of waste management.
