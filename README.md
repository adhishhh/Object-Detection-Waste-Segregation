# Project Title: Waste Segregation using Object Detection with TensorFlow

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop an application that can detect and segregate waste using object detection with TensorFlow. The application will use a machine learning model trained on a dataset of images to identify different types of waste, such as plastics, paper, metal, and glass.

The project will consist of the following steps:

Data Collection: The first step is to collect images of waste items. These images will be used to train the object detection model. The images can be collected from various sources such as online image repositories, social media, or by capturing images using a camera.

Data Preprocessing: Once the images are collected, they need to be preprocessed. This involves resizing, cropping, and labeling the images. Each image should be labeled with the type of waste it represents.

Model Training: TensorFlow will be used to train an object detection model on the labeled dataset. The model will be trained to identify different types of waste items.

Model Evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated to measure its accuracy and efficiency. The evaluation will be done by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels of the images.

Waste Segregation: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to segregate waste items. The user can take a picture of a waste item using a camera or a smartphone, and the model will identify the type of waste it belongs to. The application can then sort the waste items into different bins for recycling.

The project will be implemented using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework. The project will be hosted on GitHub, and the source code will be available for anyone to use or contribute to.

Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is to develop a waste segregation application that uses object detection with TensorFlow. The application will be able to identify different types of waste items, and sort them into different bins for recycling. The application will be accurate, efficient, and easy to use.

Potential Impact:
Waste segregation is an important step towards a sustainable future. The proposed application can help reduce waste by promoting recycling. By making waste segregation easy and accessible, the application can encourage people to recycle more and reduce their carbon footprint. The project can also serve as a learning resource for developers interested in object detection and machine learning.
